% Goal : this is an example of a function that you might have to code to
% get trial information about an experiment (i.e. number of aversive trial,
% number of neutral trial, etc.) it really depends on your experiment

% TODO:
% make it more usable, remove complex data structure, use vector instead
function trialInformation = trialInfo(trigger, experiment)
%     small function to get the information about the trial from experiment
%     data. Number of trial, number of CS+ and CS- trials and the number of
%     CS+ with US and CS+ without US trials. If your trigger data is
%     different than the _cogent_.mat file from Bach you might have to
%     lightly or heavlily modify this function. This function is useful for 
%     either the PsPM-HRA 1, PsPM-SCRV 4 or the PsPM-SCRV 1 you can modify it or
%     ignore it.
%     @return : an array with the number of total trial, CS+, CS-, CS+ with US
%     and CS+ without US.
%     @trigger (1x1 MATLAB struct): the structure the of the
%     _cogent_.mat file from the open source dataset from Bach
%     @experimenet (string): the name of the dataset you are using in this
%     function there is three possibility : "HRA_1", "SCRV_4" or "SCRV_1".
