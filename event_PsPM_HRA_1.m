% Goal : this is a good example of how to write a code that will marker
% event based on the experiment

% TODO:
% make more usable, remove complex data structure and use vector instead
function events_PsPM_HRA_1 = event_PsPM_HRA_1(trialInfo,epoch, ....
    triggerFileName, varargin)
%     Function to code trial from the PsPM-HRA 1 dataset. The experiment from 
%     this dataset is a classic pavlovien fear experiment where CS were orange 
%     or blue filled circle and US was an uncomfortable electric shock. CS+ is 
%     coded as 2, CS- as 1 and the presence of US as 1 and the absence of US as 
%     0. So there's 2 interesting conditions, the one which is suppose to 
%     elicit an EDA response is CS+ without US. This function is
%     necessary if you use the PsPM-HRA 1 dataset if not you can ignore it.
%     @return: the epoch pass has argument will be modify. Each trial will
%     be coded and added to the the epoch struct.
%     @trialInfo (1x1 MATLAB struct): the structure the of the
%     _cogent_.mat file from the open source dataset from Bach.
%     @epoch (1x1 MATLAB struct) : the output of the epochs function, look
%     above for more information.
