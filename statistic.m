% TODO:
% make it more usable, remove complex data structure, use vector instead
function stat = statistic(epoch, originalNbTrial, artifact, varargin)
%     Function to compute statistics based on computed metrics to save in a
%     file for later statistical analysis
%     @return (table) : a table containing all the computed statistics
%     (1x1 MATLAB struct) : the output of the epochs function, look
%     above for more information.
%     @originalNbTrial (int) : number of trial in total in the experiment
%     @artifact (string) : if you need to compute statistic from data which used 
%     the artifact removal tool, the parameter should be "artifact", anything 
%     string otherwise
