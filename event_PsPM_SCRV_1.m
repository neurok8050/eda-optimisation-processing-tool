% Goal : this is another example of what sort of code to write to mark
% event according to an experiment

% TODO:
% make it more usable, remove complex data structure, use vector instead
function events_PsPM_SCRV_1 = event_PsPM_SCRV_1(trialInfo, epoch, ...
    triggerFileName, varargin)
%     Function to code trial from the PsPM-SCRV 1 dataset. The experiment was to
%     show aversive and nonaversive picture from the International Affective 
%     Picture System (IAPS) and using three different Inter Stimulus Interval 
%     (ISI) so it was a 2x3 experimental design. Aversive trial were marker as 0
%     and neutral trial as 1. This function is necessary if you use the
%     PsPM-SCRV 1 dataset if not you can ignore it.
%     @return: the epoch pass has argument will be modify. Each trial will
%     be coded and added to the the epoch struct.
%     @trialInfo (1x1 MATLAB struct): the structure the of the
%     _cogent_.mat file from the open source dataset from Bach.
%     @epoch (1x1 MATLAB struct) : the output of the epochs function, look
%     above for more information.
